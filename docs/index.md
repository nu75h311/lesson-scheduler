## What is this?

The lesson-scheduler is a sample project with no intention of being commercialized. The motivation is that I am currently changing jobs, and having being away from web projects for the last couple of years, I decided to put a basic project together from scratch using most of the technologies and tools that I will be using on the new assignment.

## Why these pages?

The reasons why I am putting these pages together are two: A) for my own reference on the steps and decisions taken in order to get a well documented and well tested application to work properly; and B) to help a couple of friends that are just entering the Software Engineering world by going through all these steps together with them via periodic and remote sessions. With the latter I also hope to help myself assimilate new and old concepts (by forcing me to have a level of comprehension high enough to explain them to other people).
